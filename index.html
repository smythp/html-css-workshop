</head>

<body>

<h1>This is a header</h1>
<h3>You can change the number of the h tag to alter the size of the text</h3>
<p>This is some text in a paragraph tag</p>
<p>Paragraph tags create spaces between paragraphs, like you see on most websites</p>
<p>You can also add spaces with the br tag:</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Don't forget to close your tags! Use a slash (/) to close most tags. Some tags, like br, don't need to be closed</p>

</body>
